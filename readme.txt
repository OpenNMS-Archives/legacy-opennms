Bluebird .1e Release
===================
The .1e release is an "EUI only" set of programs which read, build and
configure the Bluebird system. NO traffic is generated by these programs.
Later, when the Distributed Poller is finished, it wil read the config
files generated by the .1 release programs.

Emphasis is on usability and functionality. Bugs are rampant and have
been generously introduced as needed to keep the experience interesting.

Manuals are not included. Please refer to the Acrobat 
documents at www.opennms.org in the members section.

Pre-Requisites
==============
To run the Bluebird application, you will need JAVA 1.2 *(SDK1.2.2),
and enough knowledge about JAVA to modify your class path and environment
variables to your system.

The enclosed binaries have been tested on NT 4.0 but should work on
any JDK1.2.2 system without modification (except for the BAT files).

Unix Users: since we cannot find a way to specify execute permission in
a jar file, the .sh files will need to have chmod 755 *sh before running.
You may also have to run dos2unix to convert the DOS format file to Unix.

Instructions for Installation:
==============================

0. Move the bluebird.jar, readme.txt and license.txt files to your computer.
   Please be aware, downloading with Netscape will bring the file in as
   ASCII text. Please use anonymous FTP at www.opennms.org for BINARY
   transfers.

1. Move the downloaded Bluebird.jar file to a directory, say 'BlueBird'

2. Extract the data and image files:

   jar -xvf BlueBird.jar

   You may have to explicitly specify the path to jar:
   /usr/local/java/bin/jar -xvf BlueBird.jar or c:\java\bin\jar

   This will create a directory called com, 2 BAT files, 2 shell files, 
   a xml4j.jar file, a license file and this readme.

3. Modify the RunAdmin.bat and RunOperator.bat files (or the
   RunAdmin.sh and RunOperator.sh files) to your environment.

   Things which must be set are:
   - the location of your java binary. The example BAT file is c:\jdk1.2.2\bin
     but on your system it may be c:\java\bin or /usr/local/java/bin
   - the classpath to the directory where the com, xml4k.jar and readme are 
     located. This should be OK as is, however, if it cannot find current 
     directory (.), you may have to explicitly specific the path.

4. Run the 'RunAdmin.bat' and 'RunOperator.bat' BAT files (or 'RunAdmin.sh" and
   'RunOperator.sh" scripts) to bring up the admin and operator panels respectively.

5. When the Bluebird login panel appears (when running RunAdmin.bat|sh), enter 
   user 'admin' and password 'admin'.

6. When the Bluebird login panel appears (when running RunOperator.bat|sh), enter
   user 'operator' and password 'operator'.

7. Browse through the various options. In the admin tool, things to try include:
   - Launch the "Configure Users, Groups and Views". Right click on a view, choose
     [Properties...] and launch the rule builder.
   - Launch the "Configure Distributed Pollers", use the right click heavily on
     various points in the Poller Packages. Drag/drop between packages and pollers
     and services to packages.
   - Launch the "Control Distributed Pollers", select a poller, view the settings,
     and select the "Refresh Operational Data" button to query the poller.
   - Service models are ways to specify behavior of device polling when a device
     is unreachable.
   - SNMP configuration allows SNMP information to be set based on ranges, specific
     devices and flat files (via URL).

     In the Operator panel, select the various views using the folder tabs at the
     top. Drill down into a category. Right click on a histogram to speed past
     levels in the hierarchy. Drill into the event browser. Use the right click to
     show details of the event. You can move views in and out of the user interface
     using the view configuration icons at the top of the panel.

8). Report bugs to bugs@opennms.org. Happy trails campers.
